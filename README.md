# RMNP Fire Effects repository for TLS and intelimon data analysis

Edited: Christina Fossum 2/10/2026

Purpose: This repository is meant to serve as a location to store and work with 
our program's intelimon TLS data. 

Workflow:
1. clone 'TLS' repository onto desktop
2. Have Christina share 'DATA' subfolder with you (keep this on desktop repo for storing actual data, but do not push to remote)
3. At the beginning of coding session, make sure to pull! Track changes to code with commit messages. At the end of your coding session make sure to push!
4. Use the 'intelimon Model Data Formatting' script to format FFI data for modeling and to pair formatted FFI 'pred' data with the matching intelimon 'vars' data.
Save these pairs in 'intelimon models' folder
5. Use demo script to create scripts for your models. Create folder to contain (1) model script, (2) pred/vars pair, (3) saved models and figures
