The following metadata describes the plot metrics output by the IntELiMon system,,,,
"""Metric"" is the name of the outputted variable",,,,
"""Description describes what the output represents",,,,
"""Scan Division"", ""Metric type"" and ""Voxelized/Point Cloud"" describe at what point in the process the metric originates from",,,,
"Abbreviations: TGI- triangular greenness index, VARI- visible atmospherically resistant index, CWD- coarse woody debris",,,,
